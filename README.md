# Activity 1
> Oregon State University - CS 340 - Introduction to Databases

**Work individually and submit URLs in Canvas.**

## Overview
You will be creating a small Parts-Supplier database in phpMyAdmin for the ER diagram given below.  You will also modify code to create a website that accesses the database using Node.js (JavaScript), HTML & CSS.

## Steps
1. Clone this repository or download the contents as a ZIP file and place the contents somewhere in your user directory on the ENGR Flip servers.
1. Update the configuration in `config.js`.
1. Log in to [phpMyAdmin] and import the `scripts/seed-db.sql` file to create the tables required for this assignment. To do this you may need to download the files locally as well or just copy/paste the SQL from the file into the SQL editor in phpMyAdmin.
1. In [phpMyAdmin]
   - Create a new table named `Suppliers` with the structure and values shown below:

     ![Suppliers Table Schema](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39965401/65824311-9c8d2180-e21b-11e9-88dd-b8b8e9d6071e.png)
     ![Suppliers Table Data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39965401/65824313-b890c300-e21b-11e9-9140-b3d492cec587.png)

   - Connect the `Catalog` table to the `Parts` and `Suppliers` tables. To do this, go to Catalog > Structure > Relation View and add the following constraints:

     ![Catalog Constraints](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39965401/65824320-e970f800-e21b-11e9-97da-4bd53a66ee28.png)

   - Go to the designer window to verify the relationship (you will need to submit a screenshot to Canvas). It should resemble the following:

     ![Designer Window Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39965401/65824318-dbbb7280-e21b-11e9-88ad-62e7bd6d5b81.png)

   - **After linking the tables**, insert two new records into the `Catalog` table.

1. From the root of this repository (where you downloaded the files):
   - Install the required dependencies and start the server

         $ npm install
         $ npm start

      > If you are using the ENGR servers, you may need to modify the `PORT` environment variable for the server to start properly. To do so, simply run   the following commands from the terminal on the Flip server, replacing `<port_number>` with the port you wish to use (a number between 2000 and   65535). You also will want to enter a `bash` shell before running your commands. Do the following:
      >
      >     $ bash
      >     $ npm install
      >     $ PORT=<port_number> npm start

1. Visit the server address from your browser. Replace `PORT` in the URLs below with the port number you used (default of 3000):
   - If you are running this locally (on your own PC, not the Flip server), use `http://localhost:PORT/suppliers`
   - If you are running this on the Flip server, use `http://flipX.engr.oregonstate.edu:PORT/suppliers`. Replace `X` with the number of the Flip server you logged in to (1, 2, or 3).

1. **Change the "My Site" text to your full name** (many students forget this). You can find the source in the `views/partials/header.hbs` file.
1. Modify the code in the `src/routes/pages.js` file according to the `TODO` statements in the code.

## Submit
Submit a screenshot of your database relationship and your URLs to Canvas.
